Description: A heterogenous Bayesian nonparametric instrumental variable approach that does not require precarious restrictive assumptions.  Bayesian nonparametrics provides non-parametric functions of the instruments and confounders via Bayesian Additive Regression Trees along with non-Normal errors by Dirichlet Process Mixtures. The treatment of interest is modelled either linearly or with a Gaussian process to allow the causal treatment effect to vary with covariates.
